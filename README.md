# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Price Prediction

This project involves using machine learning to **predict stock prices** based on historical market data. The primary objective is to forecast future prices using supervised learning and time series techniques.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

- Predict future closing prices of a stock (e.g., Apple, Tesla, Nifty 50).
- Understand price patterns through visualizations.
- Implement different models like Linear Regression, LSTM, or Random Forest.
- Evaluate model performance using real stock data.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source**: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com), [Kaggle Stock Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Features** typically include:

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Date`      | Trading date |
| `Open`      | Opening price |
| `High`      | Highest price |
| `Low`       | Lowest price |
| `Close`     | Closing price |
| `Adj Close` | Adjusted closing price |
| `Volume`    | Number of shares traded |

---

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Plotting stock price trends over time
- Moving averages (SMA, EMA)
- Volatility analysis
- Correlation between volume and price
- Daily returns and cumulative returns

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models

| Model             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Linear Regression | Basic baseline model |
| Random Forest     | Tree-based regressor for price prediction |
| LSTM              | Deep learning model suitable for time series |
